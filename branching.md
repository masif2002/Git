# Branching

* When you create a new branch, the code on the master branch and the new branch will be the same, 
but as we make updates in the new branch, those updates can only be seen in the new branch.

* Every branch tracks and keeps only the changes that have been made in their own branch.

## Why Branching?
* You create different branches when you want to add new features to your code but at the same time you don't want to break your code.
So you create a new branch, work on it, debug it, complete the feature and then merge it back to the main branch.
